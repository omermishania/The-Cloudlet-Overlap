## Encrypted Volumes

### Goals
 
- The trainee wil understand the difference between Block device encryption and Stacked filesystem encryption
- The tainee will be familiar with
    - Possible attacks on encrypted volumes
    - The following terms:
        - LUKS
        - trim
    - The following commands:
        - cryptsetup
        - encfs
        - ecryptfs
### Tasks
**_Note_**: make sure you do this tasks on a virtual machine because you **_will_** fuck things up
- Encrypt your home directory on a file system level (play with it a bit and try a few way to do it)
- Play with full disk encryption
- Add 2 disks to a VM and do the following steps: 
    - Create a mirrord logical volume
    - Encrypt the new volume using LUKS
    - Create a file system on the new encrypted volume and mount it
    - Extend the volume (check that the mounted encrypted volume is really extended)
    - Take a look on the output of lsblk and df
    - Remove one of the PV used for your LV and look at lsblk and df again
- Extreme level: Encrypt the disk containing the OS and swap space after linux installation. Why would you want to do that?
